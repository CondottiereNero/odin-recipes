# odin-recipes
This project was undertaken as part of my self-training with The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). 

The Odin Project aims to provide computer science education, in particular in the field of web development. The cursus involves a variety of assignments called "projects", which are essential for the learning process. More information at https://www.theodinproject.com/about.

This specific project consists in building a basic recipe website, and concludes the html part of the "foundations" course. More details at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

In the first stage, the project was basic. An arborescence of files and pages were built in order to emulate a recipe website, with a homepage and recipes pages, each with a corresponding picture (those all happen to come from Thai cuisine). The content itself, which is not the main point of the course, is mostly extracted from https://www.allrecipes.com/.

In the second stage, basic css was applied to provide more appeal.
